# ValidateNAT

The aim of this program is to match which external IP to which local IP when the computer
	initiates a telnet session on port 25. Hence it will give the ability to validate a few
	network tests: routing of the local and remote IPs, firewall of SMTP transactions from the
	server it is run on, outbound NAT of the local IPs on port 25.
	
There are two programs: one for Windows, one for Linux.
